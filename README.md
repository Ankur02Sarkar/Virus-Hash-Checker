# Virus-Hash-Checker
The following Code has been written to identify whether a particular file is malicious or not. The user needs to input the Hash of the file and the script automatically Identifies if the file is Malicious or Infected. This Project has been given by the Microsoft CyberSecurity Engage Team where my topic was "To Prevent another attack like Stuxnet on the Banking Sector".
